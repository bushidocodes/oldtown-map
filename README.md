# oldtown-map
oldtown-map is a JavaScript application that renders historic locations in Old Town Alexandria Virginia on a Google Map as markers. It provides a sidebar with a list of these locations and a searchable filter list that filters both the list and the markers on the map. Selecting a marker or a location on the list opens an InfoView with static information about the location. If an item has a Wikipedia ID, then the application displays a link to the Wikipedia page for the location and the infoView loads and scales thumbnail versions of the images on the locaiton's wikipedia page.

## Project Setup

oldtown-map uses ES2015 syntax and transpiles to browser-friendly syntax using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). It uses gulp as the build tool and bower to manage the following external libraries:
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Knockout
* Knockstrap (Knockout bindings for Bootstrap... not currently used by app, but useful)

The Simpler-Sidebar Bootstrap theme is provided in this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/bushidocodes/oldtown-map.git
cd oldtown-map
npm install

```

...and then open ./dist/index.html in your browser of choice
