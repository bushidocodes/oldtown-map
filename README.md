# oldtown-map
oldtown-map is a JavaScript application that renders historic locations in Old Town Alexandria Virginia on a Google Map as markers. It provides a sidebar with a list of these locations and a searchable filter list that filters both the list and the markers on the map. Selecting a marker or a location on the list opens an InfoView with static information about the location. If an item has a Wikipedia ID, then the application displays a link to the Wikipedia page for the location and the infoView loads and scales thumbnail versions of the images on the locaiton's wikipedia page.
